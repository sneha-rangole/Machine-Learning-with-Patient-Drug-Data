    "- **Workflow**: The marathon route (doesn't change)\n",
    "- **Execution**: You actually running the race (one specific run)\n",
    "\n",

    "**Total: 7 executions** of the same workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Executions Matter\n",
    "\n",

    "### What Is Data Flow?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Real-Life Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a factory assembly line:\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "Trigger → Node 1 → Node 2 → Node 3 → End\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: \"New Form Submission\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Trigger receives form data:\n",
    "   - Name: \"Sarah\"\n",
    "   - Email: \"sarah@email.com\"\n",
    "   - Message: \"Hello!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Node 1 (Send Email) receives this data\n",
    "   - Uses email field → sarah@email.com\n",
    "   - Sends confirmation email\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Node 2 (Google Sheets) receives same data\n",
    "   - Creates new row with all fields\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Node 3 (Slack) receives same data\n",
    "   - Posts: \"New submission from Sarah\"\n",
    "```\n",

    "├── Name: \"John\"\n",
    "├── Age: 30\n",

    "- Helps verify data flow from previous node\n",
    "- Troubleshoot missing fields\n",

    "Input from Webhook:\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"name\": \"Sarah\",\n",
    "  \"email\": \"sarah@email.com\",\n",

    "Problem: Next node has no data to process\n",
    "\n",
    "Debug Steps:\n",
    "1. Click the PREVIOUS node\n",
    "2. Check its Output tab\n",
    "3. Is data actually there?\n",
    "4. Are nodes connected properly?\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Causes:\n",
    "- Previous node filtered out all items\n",
    "- Wrong field name in expression\n",
    "- Node isn't connected\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Problem: {{ $json.email }} shows as \"undefined\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Debug Steps:\n",
    "1. Click node with error\n",
    "2. Check Input tab\n",
    "3. Look at actual field names\n",
    "\n",
    "Fix:\n",
    "If you see { \"userEmail\": \"...\" }\n",
    "Use {{ $json.userEmail }} instead of {{ $json.email }}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 3: \"API Request Failed\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Problem: HTTP Request node returns error\n",
    "\n",
    "Debug Steps:\n",
    "1. Check Output tab for error message\n",
    "2. Look at status code (404, 500, 401, etc.)\n",
    "3. Check Input tab for request body\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Errors:\n",
    "- 401: Bad credentials\n",
    "- 404: Wrong URL\n",
    "- 500: Server error (try again)\n",
    "- Timeout: API too slow\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario 4: \"Wrong Data Type\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Problem: Node expects number, receives text\n",
    "\n",
    "Debug Steps:\n",
    "1. Check Input data type\n",
    "2. Use Function node to convert\n",
    "3. Example: parseInt({{ $json.age }})\n",
    "\n",
    "Before: { \"age\": \"25\" } ← Text\n",

    "**1. Add Set Nodes for Debugging**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Insert \"Set\" nodes between steps:\n",
    "- Set test values manually\n",
    "- See if downstream nodes work\n",
    "- Isolate the problem area\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Use Function Nodes to Log**\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "// In Function node\n",
    "console.log('Debug: Email is', $input.all()[0].json.email);\n",
    "return $input.all();\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "If big workflow fails:\n",
    "1. Disable half the nodes\n",
    "2. Test the first half\n",
    "3. Does it work?\n",
    "4. Re-enable and test second half\n",
    "5. Binary search for problem!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Check Execution Time**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Slow execution times indicate:\n",
    "- API rate limiting\n",
    "- Large data processing\n",
    "- Network issues\n",
    "- Inefficient nodes\n",

    "**Problem:** You build entire workflow, close browser, everything gone\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** \n",
    "- Workflows auto-save when you activate them\n",
    "- Name your workflow properly\n",
    "- Check \"Workflows\" sidebar to confirm it's saved\n",

    "\n",
    "### ❌ Mistake 2: Losing Track of What Each Node Does\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** You have 20 \"HTTP Request\" nodes, can't tell them apart\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "- Rename every node descriptively\n",
    "- \"Get Customer Data\" instead of \"HTTP Request\"\n",
    "- Use sticky notes to label sections\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "**Problem:** Workflow silently failing for weeks, you don't notice\n",

    "**Solution:**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Accidentally send 100 emails to real customers during test\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",

    "- Send test emails to yourself\n",
    "- Use \"Manual Trigger\" for controlled testing\n",
