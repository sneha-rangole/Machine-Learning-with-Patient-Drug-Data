    "- **Workflow**: The marathon route (doesn't change)\n",
    "- **Execution**: You actually running the race (one specific run)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run the same marathon route 100 times = 100 executions.\n",

    "**Total: 7 executions** of the same workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Executions Matter\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "Trigger → Node 1 → Node 2 → Node 3 → End\n",
    "```\n",

    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: \"New Form Submission\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Trigger receives form data:\n",
    "   - Name: \"Sarah\"\n",
    "   - Email: \"sarah@email.com\"\n",
    "   - Message: \"Hello!\"\n",

    "   - Uses email field → sarah@email.com\n",
    "   - Sends confirmation email\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Node 2 (Google Sheets) receives same data\n",
    "   - Creates new row with all fields\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Node 3 (Slack) receives same data\n",
    "   - Posts: \"New submission from Sarah\"\n",

    "├── Name: \"John\"\n",
    "├── Age: 30\n",
